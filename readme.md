# Amazon Top Items
This is the breakdown of the top 100 electronics and top 100 smartphones sold through [Amazon.in](https://www.amazon.in/)

List can be seen for [electronics here](https://www.amazon.in/gp/bestsellers/electronics/ref=zg_bs_pg_2₹ie=UTF8&pg=2) 
and [smartphones here](https://www.amazon.in/gp/bestsellers/electronics/1805560031/ref=zg_bs_pg_2?ie=UTF8&pg=2).
## Why make this list
This is a gestimate of where exactly are the Indians spending on the e-commerce market, and it's effect towards the global market.

### Assumptions made
For making this list, I've made a lot of assumptions, which includes but not limited to:
1. Why only top 100, This is a Amazon's provided data and the assumption in this is, if the item is in top 100 best-selling item listed by amazon, that will mean the product is performing a lot better than the others. 
2. Why only reviewer_count, This is taken as a conservative estimate, which is, is x number of accounts have rated the product, then at least x number of products have been sold.
3. Rate as on 3 Aug2020, Amazon has a ever changing rate with sales and other criteria, so a regular day rate would make sense in this scenario.

## Inference

> The number one spot for the most amount of revenue generated by a brand was Redmi Xiaomi surpassing Sumsung Mobiles with a whopping 122 crores INR
> Noticed that Indian brands were making a good stand-in electronics market, and most of the brands are working as an audio device company.
> Another thing that came up during this analysis was, Brands do not make money on their flagship phones (majority), but the revenue is generated by the mid-range phones. This may be the strategy of the brands to launch a feature-rich smartphone in the market,
> Interestingly it can also be inferred that the high-end phones are heavily subsidized and the markup is covered by launching mid-range phones.
Example: Apple iPhone 11 pro max & XR
Samsung S20 ultra & M/A/... series
